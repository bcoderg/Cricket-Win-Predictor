# Cricket Match Winner Prediction Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Cricket Match Winner Prediction project! This innovative application leverages machine learning to predict the winner of cricket matches. While this project uses the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset, it can easily be adapted for other leagues and tournaments.

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze cricket match data and predict the chances of a team's victory. By inputting the relevant details, such as team names and scores, the model provides an estimate of the winning probability.

## How to Run

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary libraries and files are installed.
2. **Launch the Application**: Use Streamlit to run the frontend interface.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure you have all the dependencies installed. You can do this using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Run the Application**: Start the Streamlit application by executing the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3. **Use the Application**: Once the app is running, open your browser and navigate to the provided local URL. From there, you can select the competing teams, input their scores, and predict the chances of each team winning.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application uses Streamlit to provide an intuitive and interactive frontend.
- **Flexible Data Usage**: Although designed with IPL data, the model can be trained with data from any cricket league or tournament.
- **Accurate Predictions**: By analyzing historical match data, the machine learning model predicts winning probabilities with high accuracy.
